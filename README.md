## Instructions

1. Clone the project.
2. Change directory to the project path in a command prompt window.
3. Run "npm i font-awesome".
4. Browse to the project root directory and double-click the index.html file.

### Know issues

1. When scaling to smaller screens the grid layout is not working properly as outlined in the sketch design.
2. Pure CSS was used and therefore there are no global styling variables. Forgive me for this, I usually develop using the Angular CLI which takes care of the SCSS files and the compilation thereof, with the 2 hour time constraint I left this to focus on the completion of the screen layout.
3. No treeshaking or minifications was done.
